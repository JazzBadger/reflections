When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

In case I fear that my hard drive crashes, or if I have several computers that I use for my developments

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To avoid my branch to be overwritten by mistake, in case I am going through experiments locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is for new features, experiments, before being fully validated
A clone is a copy of an already existing repository on your local repository.
A fork is a kind of clone but on Github only

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
you get the remote reference that allows you to work when disconnected from the network.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I hardly see how collaboration is possible without Git or similar tool, unless people are not working at all on features
  depending on each other. But I would not call that collaboration.
  
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A separate branch is useful when making some trials, while allowing others to commit to the master branch. Actually, no development
  is done on the master branch, it is only used for integration.
