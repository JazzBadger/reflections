How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It focuses on what has changed when compared to a previous version of the file.
So you don't waste time by checking the lines that did not change.
fc is a command line, a graphic tool for comparing files would be much more efficient.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Because you can go back to previously working versions, and locate where bugs could have been introduced.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros : make sure you have a full logical change
Cons : if it is a too big logical change, too many changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treate each file separately?
Most documents in Google Docs are not related to other files, saving multiple files in one commit would bring very little value.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows comments to understand the logic purpose of each version
git diff shows the differences

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
because I am always able to come back to a previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I would like to use it to design my own web site.
